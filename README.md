# -Zomato-Restaurant-Rating-Predictor
From Insights to Impact: Predicting Ratings to Drive Restaurant Success
🚀 Just Completed My End-to-End Data Science Capstone Project!
📊 Project: Zomato Restaurant Rating Predictor
📁 Data Source: Kaggle Zomato Dataset (customer + country data merged manually)
✅ Project Overview:
 I developed a machine learning-based web app to predict Zomato restaurant ratings using real-world data. The aim was to uncover insights that help restaurant owners improve ratings, visibility, and customer satisfaction.
📌 Complete Process:
 🔹 🧹 Data Cleaning: Merged restaurant, cuisine, and country data
 🔹 📈 EDA: Deep dive into categorical + numerical features using histograms, box plots, count plots
 🔹 📊 Correlation Analysis: Votes (+0.31), Price Range (+0.44) had major influence on ratings
 🔹 🧠 Modeling: Trained multiple regressors
 🔸 Linear Regression → R² = 0.49
 🔸 Decision Tree → R² = 0.98
 ✅ Random Forest → Best Model → R² = 0.982, MSE ≈ 0.043
 🔹 💾 Deployment: Saved model using pickle
 🔹 🌐 Web App: Deployed via Streamlit — real-time prediction based on features like votes, delivery, and table booking.
📊 Key Insights (with Numbers!):
 1️⃣ Restaurants with >100 votes average 3.7★ vs 2.8★ for fewer votes 🗳️
 2️⃣ Table Booking = +0.89★ on avg 🪑✨
 3️⃣ Online Delivery = +0.78★ boost 🛵👍
 4️⃣ High Price Ranges (₹₹₹+) correlate with higher perceived value 💸
 5️⃣ Top Cuisines: North Indian, Chinese, Fast Food 🥘
 6️⃣ 94.4% of the data was India-based — highly localized patterns 🇮🇳
🔮 Future Scope:
 📈 Add XGBoost & Neural Networks
 📊 Build real-time interactive dashboards
 📱 Mobile-friendly design
